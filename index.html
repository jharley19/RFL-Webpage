			<h1>History</h1>
			<p>
				The greatest fantasy football league of all time was established in 2013 by commissioner Jeremy Harley. Jeremy had played fantasy football
				in years prior, but he would be stuck with inactive and incompetent commissioners and managers. Seeking a more competitive and involved
				league experience, Jeremy set out to create his very own league. Early on he found that finding quality managers was going to be very tough.
				Thus, the inaugural season in 2013 only saw 6 teams. Jeremy brought on childhood friends Brian Levesque, Zachary Przybocki, and Ben Martin
				along with his brother Brandon Harley to round out the 2013 class. If you are good at math, this only equals 5 teams, so Jeremy had to create
				a second team just to have enough for the bare minimum of teams allowed to play. Despite barely having enough teams to even play, the pilot
				year would end successfully, and this new league would be renewed for another year.
			<p>
				Going into the 2014 season, the league was set for an expansion. Knowing how hard it was to find people in the first year, Jeremy significantly
				increased his recruiting efforts. He would find much success as the league went from 5 different people to now 8, including 4 new faces. Brandon
				would part ways with the league after the first season some say due to their tragic defeat in the championship game. Jeremy would then bring on
				a slew of middle school friends including Jonathan Heng, Nick Sagun, Justin Ferguson, and the first and only female in league history Sanaya Clark.
				Though we were able to have more members, the new members were not very dedicated. There were very few active managers and there was one who never
				even set a lineup in the first place. Though it was nice to see more people apart of the league, major changes had to come to get it to be more
				competitive.
			<p>
				With the 2015 season approaching, two members Jonathan Heng and Justin Ferguson were removed for inactivity. Thus, Jeremy was back on the recruiting
				trip looking to find two more active and passionate members. In the end, Jeremy would bring on two friends from band class and fellow clarinetists
				Brian Thomas and Adam Cullen. Both Adam and Brian would do very well that season and would even make the playoffs. However, the recruits from last
				year's class were the ones who disappointed. Both Sanaya and Nick failed to even set one lineup all season long, thus making this year's season
				even less competitive than the year prior.
			<p>
				The 2016 season presented something totally different. This year would represent a lot of change in this league. Commissioner Jeremy would go to
				high school and meet some new friends and leave some old ones. First off Sanaya would be removed for inactivity, Brian Thomas would be excluded
				since he went to a different high school. Nick who was the other inactive member from last year was set to come back since we were still desperate
				for people, but Nick would back out last second and his team would be controlled by the commissioner. Then to replace the two other open positions,
				Jeremy brought on new friends Harry Heck and Tyler Ulmschneider. Much like last year, these new additions got off to a hot start as both made the
				playoffs and Tyler would even win the championship. These two early on seemed to be important pieces in the future of this league.
			<p>
				The 2017 season would come to represent what we have deemed the "new era." This new wave brought in four new members: the biggest expansion in
				league history. Adam Cullen would be removed for inactivity, Zachary Przybocki had moved away a year or so prior and we had grown apart from each
				other, Ben Martin had also grown apart from us, and Nick was not invited back. To fill these voids, Jeremy brought on soccer friend Rc Miller, new
				high school friends Michael Boswell Jr. and Zane Lehosky, and Brandon would make his return. This year would probably be known as the most important
				in league history as this was the year that things started to become more and more serious. This year we saw the infamous "Fabiano trade" where
				Gruden's Plan traded Tom Brady and LeSean McCoy to The Dictator for Marcus Mariota and Ty Montgomery. This trade was sent to NFL Fantasy Live
				via Twitter and it would make the show and Michael Fabiano would roast Gruden's Plan owner Michael Boswell Jr. for making the abysmal trade.
				This year also saw the first team video as The Dictator would celebrate their championship victory.
			<p>
				The 2018 season would be quite historic as well. It would be the first year in league history that we did not lose a single team and we even added
				two more. The league would expand into a 10-team league now including high school friends Jason Rowland and Billy Goodnow. This year we would have
				our first ever purchased draft board and championship trophy, that we granted in our first awards ceremony. We also created our first league
				constitution to have a document that contains all the rules and regulations in one place. Some new rules laid out in this document included the
				introduction of keepers for the first time, allowing a team to keep one player on their roster at the end of the season for the cost
				of losing a draft pick in the round that the player's aveage draft position is in for the next year's draft. We also saw a change to a half-ppr
				scoring format. This year saw a major increase in competition, and you
				could tell that what we had here was only going to grow.
			<p>
				In 2019, we decided to remove Tyler Ulmschneider from the league since he did not really seem to fit into the core group. Instead, we brought
				on high school friend Logan Handwork. This year we would see a lot of major changes and improvements. We would hold our first ever Annual Settings
				Summit (ASS) where we would make additions or changes to the constitution leading up to the season. This year, we would see the creation of the FRC
				who was created as a commissioner appointed congress that served to advise the Commissioner and oversee trades to assure there would be no collusion
				nor drastically unfair deals. Waivers were also introduced and thus there would be no more free-for-all and advantage given to those quickest on the
				draw. We would also establish our first league punishment for the last place finisher which was draft day torture for the following season. The last
				place finisher would be determined through the Panzerkampfwagen Bowl that would pit the 9th and 10th place finishers against one another for an epic
				two-week showdown, where the loser would be punished. Kickers were also officially removed from the league in favor of a second FLEX spot. Draft day
				saw a big change with the inclusion of confessionals, where people could record their reactions and strategies as the draft went on, which was later
				turned into an award-winning video. This year The Dictator would make the first ever team name announcement video and then go on to make weekly diss
				tracks for their opponent that week until they made one for every other team in the league. From there, Jeremy would release a weekly recap of the
				games and a preview of next week's games. Here he and whoever else would participate would give their picks based on the RFL matchups that week and
				also a lock and upset for the NFL games. When the season ended, this show was then discontinued. But by this time, The Dictator had single-handedly
				made videos an integral part of the league culture. The award ceremony saw a big change as well as we would conduct exit interviews, where we would
				confront owners about things that they said at the draft day confessionals, discuss their year's performance, and hear their plans going into next
				season.
			<p>
				Leading up to the 2020 season, we would let go of Logan Handwork from the league due to a lack of participation since work and school weighed heavy
				on his plate. Logan was then immediately added to Gruden's Plan as a co-manager, marking the first ever time a former owner has become a co-manager.
				In deciding who to bring in to fill that last spot, old friend Nick Sagun came into the conversation. Nick had served as The Wentz Wagon's co-manager
				in 2019 and seemed to now have a real interest in what this league has become. But we could not just give him the job as there was a lot of skepticism
				surrounding his qualifications. We then established in our first ever in-person Annual Settings Summit that to be admitted into this league, one would
				have to interview with the Commissioner and the FRC, together known as The Inclusion Tribunal (TIT), a major change from the early years of begging
				people to join. Other major changes made at the ASS included putting money on the line for the first time and the creation of the Waiver Wire Draft.
				The first TIT interview was then conducted with Nick, which he passed, and he was accepted officially into the league. The 2020 offseason also saw
				the creation of team press conferences when a major change was announced including hiring and firing of co-managers and an introductory press
				conference for new managers. We also saw the popularization of team name announcement videos including ones released by Babylon, The Dictator,
				The Red Army, Sleepy Nick, and The Red Wolf of Wall Street. The 2020 Draft would mark the first draft with 100% in-person attendance and also was
				held outdoors for the first time and was kicked off by the first ever presentation of the league national anthem performed by the inaugural
				Panzerkampfwagen Bowl losing team of Zane Lehosky and Nick Sagun. Once the season was under way, we would see The Dictator put out weekly propaganda
				videos called "7 Minutes of Hate", where The Dictator would comment on major league stories and discuss the state of their team. At the awards
				ceremony, we saw a series of waterbets paid out, The Red Army's pie in the face punishment, and mini footballs were used as trophies instead of
				certificates.
