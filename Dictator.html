				<h1>Biography</h1>
				<p>
					The Dictator is acknowledged as the founding team of the RFL. Since the league's inception,
					the owner of The Dictator, Jeremy Harley, has also ruled as the league's commissioner.
				<p>
					In 2013, The Dictator would claim the inaugural championship posting the most points for on the season and set a record for the most points for on
					a week with 156.48 points, a record that would stand for five years until half-ppr was introduced into the league.
				<p>
					The next year, The Dictator looked
					to go back-to-back and again ended the season with the most points for, but this time in second place at 12-2. They would make the championship game and
					would ultimately fall to one of the strongest teams in league history, The Huntingtown Hurricanes owned by childhood friend Zachary Przybocki. The following year The Dictator sought
					revenge.
				<p>
					In the 2015 season, for the first time The Dictator did not finish the season with the most points, as their rival the Huntingtown Hurricanes would. However, The Dictator
					finished the regular season in first place at 11-3. Again, The Dictator would reach the championship game for the third consecutive year and again would
					meet their rival The Huntingtown Hurricanes in the championship. This time The Dictator would come away with the win to achieve their second championship.
				<p>
					The 2016 season would see The Dictator reassert his dominance as they would finish the regular season again in first place for the third time in four years
					and would have the highest point total for the third time in four years. However, his team would disappoint in the first round and The Dictator would fail to make
					the championship game for the first time in league history.
				<p>
					The Dictator then went into the 2017 seeking to rise back to the top. Despite finishing the season
					with the highest point total for the fourth time in five years, The Dictator only snuck into the playoffs at 8-6 on the season. With a decisive win in the first
					round, The Dictator would make it back to the championship for the fourth time in five years. In the championship, he would face the Cookie Charizards
					owned by the lucky Tyler Ulmschneider. The Dictator would be trailing by 11.40 points going into Monday Night Football and the only player they had left was Texans wide receiver
					DeAndre Hopkins. However, the Texans had nothing to play for and third string quarterback T.J. Yates was playing. Hopkins was not doing much all game
					and the Texans were down 27-0 in the middle of the 4th quarter. They were driving down the field and Hopkins needed a touchdown for The Dictator to win this game. On first
					and goal, Yates threw a fade to Hopkins in the back of the end zone and Hopkins made an insane one-handed bobble catch that allowed The Dictator to win their
					third championship in just five years. The force that The Dictator accredited their 2017 Championship was their lucky charm Scabby Katie. By being nice to a
					girl that was covered in scabs (and would eat them) and giving her high fives, The Dictator noticed that his team's performance would improve.
				<p>
					In 2018,
					Scabby Katie became more than just a lucky charm to The Dictator, as she became a goddess.
					This devotion allowed The Dictator to have the highest scoring team on the season, despite also
					having the worst draft. However, their playoff run came up short as they lost in the first round and
					finished in 3rd place thanks to a variety of untimely injuries on some of their biggest stars. The Dictator grew angry and blamed their shortcoming
					on Scabby Katie, as they even burned her picture. During the offseason on a stroll with Lord Brian, The Dictator discovered an interesting message
					which he interpreted as proclaiming the Lord of Light as the true fantasy god.
				<p>
					Thus in 2019, The Dictator devoted their season to The Lord of Light. As a part of his devotion to the Lord of Light, The Dictator decided to
					spit straight fire and over the course of the season recorded a diss track for every other team in the league, including the award winning
					"Mike Diss," which was even removed from YouTube. Despite his unwavering devotion to the Lord of Light,
					The Dictator was left in the darkness and would miss the playoffs for the first time in league history and they finished the season in 6th place.
				<p>
					After contemplating retirement, The Dictator realized that there is no fantasy god, there is only him and his glory. To help bear the load,
					The Dictator brought on an intern whom he dubbed "The Dictern." The Dictator would release a weekly propaganda show entitled "7 Minutes of Hate"
					where The Dictator would comment on major league stories and discuss the state of their team. The Dictator struggled throughout the year
					and would end the season with their worst performance in league history and ended up in the Panzerkampfwagen Bowl where they would defeat
					The Red Army and avoid an embarrassing league punishment. The poor performance prompted The Dictator to fire The Dictern.
				<p>
					After the 2020 season,
					it was discovered that The Dictern had purposefully sabotaged The Dictator's 2020 season and now plans to do the same for their 2021 season.
					Meanwhile, The Dictator has entered therapy and has discovered a breakthrough while looking at some inkblots. This led him to take a pilgrimage to the
					holy land, where three years before he had burned the picture (thus the soul) of Scabby Katie. Upon arrival, The Dictator would deliver an emotional apology
					and would beg for Scabby Katie's forgiveness. After breaking down in tears, a baseball bat appeared and began emitting a sound. The Dictator cautiously approached
					and realized that this bat now possessed the soul of his beloved Scabby Katie. Just as he began to grab the bat, his wrist was slashed by his former employee, The Dictern.
					The Dictern expressed that he wanted revenge for the treatment he experienced while working for The Dictator and that he desired to kill The Dictator and become the new
					Dictator. Before he would pull the trigger, the Dictern elected to torture The Dictator by spearing the end of his rifle into the left eye of The Dictator. As The Dictator
					began to cry out in pain, and the baseball bat began to twitch more and more. Eventually, the bat would fly through the air, striking the Dictern and knocking him to the ground, and
					the bat would land in the hand of a now-standing Dictator. The Dictern would retreat into the woods in fear as The Dictator would collapse due to the injuries he had sustained.
					Luckily, the Dictffcer was concerned with The Dictator leaving by himself and followed him. Now the Dictffcer was able to bring the unconscious Dictator back to their
					headquarters, where The Dictator would be healed and given a new look. The iconic shirt and tie were ditched in favor of a bulletproof vest and an eye patch, a look that now
					represents a time of war for The Dictator. But before he could move his focus to the other teams in the league, he wanted to neutralize the threat of the Dictern. A search party
					went out and the Dictffcer would find the Dictern as he was regrouping and plotting a bombing on The Dictator's headquarters. The Dictern was brought in front of The Dictator to
					pay for his crimes. Despite the Dictern's pleading and begging, The Dictator sentenced the Dictern to death, which The Dictator carried out himself with the use of Scabby Katie. Now with
					that chapter of his life out of the way, The Dictator, alongside Scabby Katie, looked to finally reclaim what is rightfully theirs. The Dictator would amass one of their better drafts
					in recent seasons, however, two of their players drafted would tear their ACLs before the season even began (JK Dobbins and Gus Edwards). Because of these injuries, The Dictator would struggle
					early on but after many favorable trades, they would add Keenan Allen, Jalen Hurts, and Nick Chubb to their squad. This new look helped The Dictator to win three straight games at the end
					of the regular season and would allow them to sneak into a playoff spot for the first time since 2018. In the playoffs, they would sneak by the Maryland Marijuanas as Alvin Kamara got just enough
					points on Monday Night Football to punch The Dictator's ticket into their first championship game since 2017. They would eventually lose this game and fall just short of reclaiming what
					was assumed to be rightfully theirs.
