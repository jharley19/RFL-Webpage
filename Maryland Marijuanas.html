                <h1>Biography</h1>
                <p>
                    The Maryland Marijuanas entered the league in 2016 and had a very impressive showing from the get-go. In his first season, they finished the regular season
                    at 11-3 in second place on the back of the Aaron Rodgers and Jordy Nelson stack. However, this dominance seemed to fade in playoffs as his team put up
                    two underwhelming performances and would end the year in 4th place.
                <p>
                    This slide in the playoffs would continue in to the 2017 season as the Maryland Marijuanas put up one of the worst seasons in league history. The
                    Maryland Marijuanas would fail to get a single win until week 12 and would finish the year in last place at 1-13. This performance made the Maryland Marijuanas
                    become a laughingstock.
                <p>
                    Coming off a bad year, the Maryland Marijuanas hoped to change this narrative in 2018. Again, they elected to make Drew Brees their quarterback and their team would
                    continue to underperform. This time they would finish the year at 6-8 and would lose both games in the postseason and finished again in eighth place.
                <p>
                    Entering the 2019 season, the Maryland Marijuanas knew things needed to change. Now they would fully adopt a unique strategy that they hoped would
                    help improve their team. This plan was called the "no plan plan" where the drafter would conduct very little research prior to the draft and tries only
                    to draft Caucasian wide receivers. A strategy that seemed crazy to some, but it helped the Maryland Marijuanas reclaim their 2016 form. The Maryland Marijuanas
                    finished the regular season at 10-4 in second place. They would finally get their first playoff win in a narrow defeat of the Goofy God.
                    They then were set for their first championship match where they lost by nearly 40 points. Despite a disappointing finish, the Maryland Marijuanas
                    were acknowledged as the year's Comeback Player of the Year.
                <p>
                    Even though last year was not the desired outcome, the Maryland Marijuanas came in to the 2020 season with the same strategy. This time however, they
                    elected to bring on Ben Adams as a co-manager. But shortly after this hire, Ben would be released due to a core disagreement about the vision for the team. The Maryland Marijuanas
                    would make a season altering move when they decided to make a major trade with Gruden's Plan. This trade would be awarded the trade rape of the year
                    and not in the Maryland Marijuanas' favor. The Maryland Marijuanas would let their love for white receivers and their toxic relationship with Drew
                    Brees cloud their judgement as they would trade away Patrick Mahomes, Alvin Kamara, DeSean Jackson, and a 1st Round WWD pick for Drew Brees,
                    Adam Thielen, Todd Gurley, and Zach Ertz. Despite this terrible move, the Maryland Marijuanas would make the playoffs finishing the regular season
                    in third place at a mere 8-6. They would ironically lose in the first round thanks to the star players they had traded away, and the Maryland Marijuanas
                    ended their campaign in third place.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Coming into the 2021 season, the Maryland Marijuanas looked to avenge a rather embarrassing 2020 season. They would kick off the season on the right note with the
                    best draft in league history, selecting 11 top players at their positions. This allowed them to win six out of their first eight matches and accumulate the most points
                    in a single season in league history. The Maryland Marijuanas would enter the playoffs as the one seed and had the task of facing The Dictator in the first round. The Maryland
                    Marijuanas would suffer a heartbreaking loss to the league's most experienced playoff team. For the third year in a row, the Maryland Marijuanas would leave the playoffs
                    empty-handed.
