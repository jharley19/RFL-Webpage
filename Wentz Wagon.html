            <h1>Biography</h1>
            <p>
                The Hurts Helicopter entered the league in 2017 and they started with a bang, but not in a good way. The Hurts Helicopter quickly made an unprecedented move by
                sleeping through the entirety of the draft (the draft started in the afternoon). Because of this, The Hurts Helicopter was left with scraps as the league
                does not approve of auto-draft. This band of misfits performed just as you would expect, and they finished the regular season at 7-7 in 6th place. Then
                in the Loser's bracket, they ended up finishing in 7th place, just escaping the dreaded last place.
            <p>
                Now going into the 2018 season, The Hurts Helicopter would be awake for the draft and could now build his own team for the first time. With their own squad,
                The Hurts Helicopter disappointed again finishing the regular season at 7-7 and in 6th place. However, The Hurts Helicopter managed to show up for the postseason
                and earn the 1st overall pick for the 2019 season.
            <p>
                Coming into the 2019 season with the first pick, The Hurts Helicopter decided to make another big addition by adding close friend Nick Sagun as their co-manager.
                Nick however was late to the draft and could not stop The Hurts Helicopter from selecting Le'Veon Bell with the first overall pick. A disappointing draft
                then led to a disappointing season. They would win their first game and would go on to lose the next eight. They would end the regular season in last place
                at 3-11 and would go on to lose to The Red Army in the first ever Panzerkampfwagen Bowl. The Hurts Helicopter would then suffer the first league sanctioned punishment
                as they would perform the league national anthem at the beginning of the 2020 Draft and act as the "sticker bitches" for the entirety of the draft.
            <p>
                Going into the 2020 season, co-manager Nick Sagun was able to own his own team and thus parted ways with The Hurts Helicopter. Following their embarrassing
                and honestly underwhelming punishment, The Hurts Helicopter set out to begin their revenge tour. They started their season hot at 3-1 and from there they
                would win nine straight games, allowing them to finish the regular season at 12-2 in first place. The Hurts Helicopter was a legit wagon and had a lot of
                steam going into their first playoffs. They would squeak out a win in the first round against their former co-manager's new team and would reach their first
                championship match. Despite a strong showing, The Hurts Helicopter ultimately fell to Gruden's Plan and finished the year in second place.
            </p>
            <p>
                Entering into the 2021 season, The Hurts Helicopter decided it was time for a big change. Their beloved Philadelphia Eagles had moved on from quarterback Carson Wentz,
                so The Hurts Helicopter elected to do the same changing their name from "The Wentz Wagon" to "The Hurts Helicopter."
