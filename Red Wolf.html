                <h1>Biography</h1>
                <p>
                    The Goofy God entered the league in 2018 and was a force to be reckoned with from the start. In their first season, they would make the playoffs
                    in third place at 10-4 thanks in large part to a five-game winning streak to end the season. Coming in hot in the playoffs, their winning streak would
                    come to screeching halt as they put up only 58.86 points losing to the eventual champion Big Ounce. They would lose again in the third-place game to finish
                    in fourth place.
                <p>
                    Now going into the 2019 season, The Goofy God decided to keep stud running back, Saquon Barkley, looking to improve from last year's fourth place
                    performance. This season was very similar to their previous one as they struggled at first but would finish the year in third place at 9-5 thanks to now a six-game
                    winning streak to end the season. Now in the playoffs, the Goofy God looked to keep their streak alive and win their first playoff game. This
                    time they narrowly lost to The Maryland Marijuanas and then lost again in third place game to finish in fourth place for the second straight season.
                <p>
                    Coming into the 2020 season, Goofy God was painted as the Marvin Lewis of the league in that they could always make the playoffs but could
                    never win a game. The Goofy God then contemplated quitting, but after illegally consuming some alcohol, he decided that he was "not fucking leaving."
                    To accompany this new culture, they changed their name to "The Red Wolf of Wall Street." The good news is this culture change allowed The Goofy God
                    to finally get a different result, but not a better one. Their top draft picks were riddled with injuries and their team struggled throughout the season. They
                    narrowly escaped the Panzerkampfwagen Bowl at 5-9 and finished the regular season in 7th place. This time in the postseason, the Goofy God
                    shined, and they would go on to claim the first overall pick for the 2021 season.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Entering the 2021 season, the Goofy God wanted another new look. However, this time they wanted a name and a brand that would stand the test of time. After some heavy contemplation
                    in the Buffalo Wild Wings parking lot at 1 o'clock in the morning following the season opening Hall of Fame game, they would land on a new team name: "Goofy God." This new name
                    not only is representative of him denying a bad bitch because she is "too goofy", but also incorporates his favorite rap artist Eminem, since Eminem refers to himself as the "Rap God."
                    A third meaning in the name is seen in its initials: "GG," as the Goofy God is notorious for always saying "GG" in the group chat before the game is even over.
