                <h1>Biography</h1>
                <p>
                    Gruden's Plan entered the league in 2017 and had a chip on their shoulder from the beginning. However, they quickly realized that they
                    may be a little in over their heads as they finished the season in 6th place thanks in large part to the league's most infamous trade rape
                    where Gruden's Plan sent over Tom Brady and LeSean McCoy to The Dictator in exchange for Marcus Mariota and Ty Montgomery. This trade was
                    so atrocious that it would be mocked on national television by the former NFL Fantasy Analyst Michael Fabiano.
                <p>
                    After realizing that this
                    league is tougher than they first thought, Gruden's Plan brought in former North Point High School kicker Evan Patterson as his co-manager
                    for the 2018 season, making him the first ever co-manager in league history. They would also adopt the new name "Gruden's Plan" as a nod to
                    the owner's favorite NFL coach Jon Gruden. The addition of co-manager, a new team name, and a draft that he roster-baited to only inflated
                    the hype and the confidence of Gruden's Plan. However, the shock of reality would hit, and they would finish the season with a mere 2 wins in
                    last place. This poor performance made many skeptical of Gruden's Plan, as even The Red Army declared that "Gruden has no plan." Following
                    this disappointing season, Gruden's Plan and Evan agreed to "mutually part ways" and Gruden's Plan went on a search for a new co-manager
                    for the 2019 season.
                <p>
                    A few weeks prior to the 2019 draft, Gruden's Plan announced that they will be bringing on unstable friend Jacob Kernster
                    as their new co-manager. However, on the day of the draft, Gruden's Plan showed up without Jacob and announced that he had been let go for
                    reasons still unknown. Gruden's Plan would go into the 2019 season without a co-manager and would begin the season 3-1 and sat in first place.
                    However, their team soon began to fall apart and would even lose the last 7 games of the season to finish the year in 8th place.
                <p>
                    Knowing that he could not find success on his own, Gruden's Plan went in search of a new co-manager. That season, The Washington
                    Buttkickers and owner Logan Handwork had been gracefully removed from the league for lack of participation. Gruden's Plan would then
                    immediately offer Mr. Handwork a co-manager position that he graciously accepted. This year Gruden's Plan seemed to turn things around.
                    Firstly, they completed a major trade with the Maryland Marijuanas that would be named the 2020 Trade Rape of the year, this time in
                    Gruden's Plan's favor. In this trade they received Patrick Mahomes, Alvin Kamara, DeSean Jackson, and a 1st round Waiver Wire Draft pick
                    for Todd Gurley, Adam Thielen, Zach Ertz, and Drew Brees. Gruden's Plan continued to make smart trades as they traded away Derrick Henry
                    and a recently injured Austin Ekeler over to Babylon for DeAndre Hopkins, Travis Kelce, and Devin Singletary. With the help of these additions
                    Gruden's Plan would set some league records including the most points in a week at 201.80 points and the most points by player in a week with
                    Alvin Kamara's championship week 54.70 points. All this led Gruden's Plan to their first championship in franchise history. Now was this season
                    just a fluke? Or might Gruden now actually have a plan? Only time will tell.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Entering the 2021 season, Gruden's Plan sought to go back-to-back. However, a slower start and no severely lopsided deals in their favor made this task
                    seem distant. Gruden's Plan would rip off three straight wins toward the end of the season and in the last week of the regular season would still have a path
                    into the playoffs if many things went their way. They would end up losing their final game to Sleepy Nick so Gruden's Plan would miss the playoffs for the fourth
                    time in five years. In the consolation bracket, they would lose both games and finish the year in eighth place. After this disappointing season, Gruden's Plan would
                    let go of his championship-winning co-manager Logan Handwork and hire friend Ben Hatfield to take his place.
