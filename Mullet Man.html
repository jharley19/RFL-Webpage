                <h1>Biography</h1>
                <p>
                    The Mullet Man entered the league in 2018 and found great struggle from the start. Their first draft was a rough experience as they assembled a below
                    average roster and even swapped picks with Gruden's Plan where they received nothing in return other than more time to think about a pick. This translated
                    immediately as they started their season with five straight losses and would end the year at a pitiful 2-12 in 9th place. This was a rude awakening for
                    the Mullet Man. They soon realized that success in this league was going to be harder than they originally thought.
                <p>
                    Now going into the 2019 season, the Mullet Man would be the only team to not select a keeper. This was an interesting strategy that caught much of the league
                    off guard. This strategy allowed The Mullet Man to have their best season in franchise history as they would finish the regular season just outside the
                    playoffs in 5th place at 7-7. They would go on to win the next two games and clinch the first overall pick for the 2020 season.
                <p>
                    Coming into the 2020 season, the Mullet Man had the first overall pick and knew that they were going to select the running back from their favorite NFL
                    team, Christian McCaffery, since December. But before the draft, the Mullet Man decided to sign recently released Ben Adams on as their co-manager.
                    Their draft left many teams questioning their picks including selecting George Kittle in the second round, T.Y. Hilton in the fourth round, unknown rookie
                    Antonio Gibson in the ninth round, and of course the recently released Derrius Guice in the fifteenth round. This poor decision making combined with an
                    unfortunate early injury to Christian McCaffery spelled doom for the Mullet Man. In an attempt to stop their bleeding, the Mullet Man engaged in the most
                    trades in a single season in league history with 8 total deals made. This however could not stop The Mullet Man from missing the playoffs for the third
                    straight season. They would finish the regular season at 6-8 in 6th place. They would ultimately finish the year in 7th place. They are the only current
                    non-rookie team to never make the playoffs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Entering the 2021 season, co-manager Ben Adams had drawn interest as the next franchise owner in the league, but he had failed to pass his interview. Ben then
                    displayed some disinterest in his current role on the Mullet Man and wanted to explore his options on the open market. He was very interested in signing with
                    Sleepy Nick, where he thought he would have more control over the decision making, but the team was not interested in bringing on any further consultation. Ben would
                    then re-sign with the Mullet Man.
