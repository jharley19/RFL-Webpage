            <h1>Biography</h1>
            <p>
                Big Ounce began its first reign in the league's inaugural season in 2013. There, Big Ounce had a strong season showing finishing at 10-3 in second place.
                They would win in the first round and punched their ticket to the first ever championship match. Here, they would fall to the first seed The Dictator.
                Following this defeat, Big Ounce felt dejected and went on a hiatus and was not heard from for nearly
                four years until he decided to return for the 2017 season.
            <p>
                In their first year back, rust showed early on, and Big Ounce would narrowly miss the playoffs.
                Instead of mysteriously leaving the league again after this underwhelming performance, Big Ounce decided to hold on hope and looked forward to the
                2018 season.
            <p>
                In 2018, Big Ounce would return to his 2013 form and finished the regular season at 10-4 and once again in second place.
                They would again punch their ticket to championship match and would be pitted against the first seed Cookie Charizards. This time
                Big Ounce decisively defeated their opponent and would win their first championship.
            <p>
                In 2019, Big Ounce sought to go "back-to-back" and they would bring on longtime friend, Alexis Garcia, as a co-manager to help accomplish this task.
                Then with the help of his elite keeper, Christian McCaffery, this goal did not seem so farfetched.
                They finished the year at 11-3 in first place and with the most points for on the season. Big Ounce looked dominant, and the playoffs would be
                no different. Scoring over 140 points in each of their playoff matches, Big Ounce would easily claim their second championship and would accomplish
                the illustrious "back-to-back" and would be the first franchise in league history to do so.
            <p>
                In the 2020 season, Big Ounce sought out a "three peat" and achieve three straight championships. Without his baby Christian McCaffery this goal
                seemed to be nearly impossible. After a poor draft and some early injuries to their top picks, Big Ounce struggled all season and spent most of
                the year in last place. With some help from their first overall Waiver Wire Draft picks, Big Ounce finally was able to climb out of the Panzerkampfwagen
                Bowl and would lose both games in the Toes Bowl bracket to finish at 8th on the season.
            </p>
            <p>
                The 2021 season presented an opportunity to avenge a rather uncharacteristic 2020 season. Big Ounce, however, still struggled at the draft selecting only 5 top players
                at their positions along with bums like David Johnson. Big Ounce would also deal with numerous injuries with most of their top selections, including Derrick Henry
                who was carrying Big Ounce through the first part of their season before falling to a season-ending injury. Despite all this hardship, Big Ounce was able to finish the regular season
                in 2nd place. In the playoffs, they would fall in the first round to the eventual champion, The Hurts Helicopter, despite putting up 139.88 points. Big Ounce would then finish the season in
                4th place.
