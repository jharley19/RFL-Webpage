                <h1>Biography</h1>
                <p>
                    Sleepy Nick entered the league originally in 2014 and did not take this league very seriously. They spent very little time trying to improve their team and
                    ended the regular season with a mere 2 wins finishing the year in 7th place.
                <p>
                    Now going into the 2015 season, experts estimated that Sleepy Nick would realize his mistakes that were made in the last season and improve upon his team
                    and finally take this league seriously. The experts were wrong. This year, Sleepy Nick found a way to take the league even less seriously as they failed
                    to ever set a starting lineup and ended the year with 0 wins and in 7th place once again.
                <p>
                    Following the 2015 season, Sleepy Nick was removed from the league due to negligence. Sleepy Nick and owner Nick Sagun were not heard from again for nearly
                    4 years.
                <p>
                    Leading up to the 2019 season, Nick Sagun reemerged onto to the scene when The Hurts Helicopter decided to bring him on as a co-manager. Here in his new role, Nick
                    helped The Hurts Helicopter finish the year in last place. Despite a poor finish, Nick seemed to finally be engaged in this league and ready to take it seriously.

                <p>
                    Lucky enough for him, a spot would open for the 2020 season and Nick would become a top candidate. Some members of the FRC still questioned the commitment of
                    Nick due to his unfaithful past in this league. This prompted the first ever TIT interview where Nick's competence and commitment would be tested. Nick ultimately
                    passed the interview and was once again granted a spot in the RFL. He would declare that much like the haters would sleep on him; he would sleep on the haters. This
                    along with his narcoleptic tendencies prompted him to announce his new team name, "Sleepy Nick." Many teams did sleep on Sleepy Nick as despite a slew of
                    questionable decisions and a bad draft, Sleepy Nick would show that they are incredibly resilient and would just find ways to win games, despite an underwhelming roster.
                    This resilience allowed them to sneak into a playoff spot for the first time at a measly 7-7. However, they would show their true colors in the postseason and would lose
                    both games to finish the year in 4th place.
