            <br /> <strong>Biography</strong>
            <p>
                Babylon entered the league in 2017 and found great success from the start. In their first 7 games they would get 6 wins and would go on to finish
                their first regular season in first place at 10-4. Entering their first playoff matchup, they had an unfortunate draw as they were pitted against
                the experienced The Dictator. Babylon would show typical first playoff game jitters and failed to break 100 points and lose in decisive fashion to
                the eventual champion. They
                would win in the consolation game, however, and finish their first year in third place.
            <p>
                Now going into the 2018 season, Babylon desired to return to the playoffs, now with some experience. Babylon's playoff hopes would go down to the very
                last game of the season. They were in a tie with The Dictator, the same team that had eliminated them from the playoffs a year prior, for the last
                playoff spot, but The
                Dictator would have the tie breaker. Therefore, to get into the playoffs, Babylon would need to win, and The Dictator would need to lose. Babylon would
                do their part and get a victory, but The Dictator remained strong and would clinch the last playoff spot. Babylon thus finished the regular season
                in 5th place at 9-5. In the postseason, they would achieve a 7th place finish.
            <p>
                After a crushing end to their 2018 campaign, Babylon wanted to get back on track and make the playoffs again. Babylon performed well once again and
                would finish the year at 9-5 and this time that record was good enough to clinch the playoffs in 4th place. Babylon now sought to enter their
                first ever championship match. Babylon would face off against last year's champion Big Ounce and they would put up a major fight. In the end, despite
                putting up a whopping 161.22 points, Babylon would fall to the eventual champion Big Ounce. Babylon would go on to win the consolation game and finish
                the season in 3rd place for the second time in three years.
            <p>
                Entering the 2020 season, Babylon decided to make some big changes. These were highlighted in an infamous video announcing their new team name.
                This video started out in a very sexual manner with the PornHub Community intro and a well-placed bottle inside owner Rc Miller's pants as he uttered the
                line "I'm coming in [to this season] harder than ever." Soon this raunchy video would take a dramatic turn. Babylon would equate their success
                in this league to the high number of trades they do every season and for this reason, they decided to make their new team name based upon an ancient
                city that used trade to grow rich and powerful: Babylon. The second half of the video was simply a lesson about the history of Babylon straight out
                of the AP World History textbook. This video got a lot of laughs and was ridiculed and was even famously mocked in The Dictator's award winning 7 Minutes of Hate video.
                Nevertheless, Babylon would go into the season highly motivated. Despite this motivation, he would start the season with just 1 win in five weeks mostly
                due to some questionable draft decisions as they employed a zero-rb strategy. To put themselves
                back on track, they would revert to what they know: trade. In week 5, Babylon would make a highly criticized trade with Gruden's Plan as Babylon would receive
                Derrick Henry and Austin Ekeler, who was recently placed on injured reserve, for DeAndre Hopkins, Travis Kelce, and Devin Singletary. This with some other moves
                improved their year and they would finish the year just one game short of the playoffs once again. Babylon would finish the year in 6th place.
            <p>
                At the conclusion of the 2020 season, owner Rc Miller became increasingly annoying. He had already been on the outskirts of the friend group and his actions
                at Jeremy's NFL playoff watch parties only pushed him further away. He would even find a way to piss off one of the most mild-mannered people in the league by
                just repeating "Corvette Corvette" ad nauseam, as a way to mock the Pittsburgh Steelers’ embarrassing playoff loss to the Cleveland Browns. This sparked a conversation about Rc's fit in the league and the team owners would even assemble a petition that
                was signed by everyone requesting to remove Babylon from the league. The Commissioner approved this petition and Babylon was then removed from the league.

            <br /> <strong>Biography</strong>
            <p>
                Logan Handwork, a high school friend of the Commissioner, was allowed entry into the league for the 2019 season. In their first year, The Washington Buttkickers
                would be absent for the draft and when asked to send in their first pick, they uttered the infamous line: "Just give me the top two players." Following this statement,
                The Washington Buttkickers would go on to have a mediocre season finishing the year in 7th place. The Washington Buttkickers would then show up for their first
                league event at the awards ceremony in January. Their season was underwhelming in terms of involvement, and they had seemed too busy with college and work to

            <br /> <strong>Biography</strong>
            <p>
                The Cookie Charizards entered the league in 2016 and found great success from the start. The Cookie Charizards were by no stretch of the imagination
                smart, but they would always find success. In their first season, The Cookie Charizards would finish the regular season in third place at 9-5. They went
                in to their first playoff game on a 4-game winning streak and this streak would continue throughout the playoffs as the Cookie Charizards would claim the
                championship trophy in their first season, the only one to do it in their first season since the inaugural year in 2013.
            <p>
                Now going into the 2017 season, The Cookie Charizards sought to go back-to-back. They would continue to take as much stock in the Chiefs offense as possible,
                this time drafting Alex Smith, Spencer Ware, and Travis Kelce. This unique strategy continued to work for them as they finished the regular season again in
                third place at 9-5. In the playoffs they would handedly defeat The Red Army in the first round and advance to back-to-back championship games. They would
                face off against The Dictator, whom they had already defeated twice during the season. However, they would lose in heart-breaking fashion as it came down to
                the very end of Monday Night Football. The Cookie Charizards would finish their second year in second place.
            <p>
                Coming into the 2018 season, The Cookie Charizards would bring the same strategy that led them to back-to-back championship games: the Chiefs stack. This time
                The Cookie Charizards would draft Alex Smith, Spencer Ware, Kareem Hunt, and Travis Kelce. This strategy would work for a third straight season as they
                would win 10 out of their first eleven games, finishing the regular season in first place at 11-3. Looking to make it to a third straight championship game,
                they faced off against last year's champion The Dictator and would squeak out a victory despite a poor performance and would punch their ticket to a third
                straight championship. Here in their third championship, they would lose decisively to Big Ounce and they would finish in second place in back-to-back years.
            <p>
                The Cookie Charizard's owner Tyler Ulmschneider was admitted into this league due to his friendship with the Commissioner Jeremy Harley. Tyler was someone who stepped up
                to be an owner in a time of great need for this league and for that we will forever be thankful. However, the 2018 season would be the last year that Jeremy and Tyler
                would be in high school and since they both were planning on going to different colleges, it was only right to let go of Tyler, someone who never really mixed well with the
                rest of the group. It should not be soon forgotten that The Cookie Charizards were one of the most dominant teams in RFL history.

            <br /> <strong>Biography</strong>
            <p>
                Zachary Przybocki, a childhood friend of the Commissioner, was allowed entry into the league in its inaugural season. Zach would enter the league at the young age
                of just eleven years old, making him the youngest owner in league history. In their first year, The Huntingtown Hurricanes would struggle to muster up wins
                as they finished the regular season at 5-8, but it was good enough for fourth place. Entering their first playoff game, The Huntingtown Hurricanes seemed to
                disappear as they put up a pitiful 62.30 points and ultimately finished the season in 5th place.
            <p>
                Now being a year older and going into the 2014 season, The Huntingtown Hurricanes sought to make their mark on league history. And they did. The Huntingtown Hurricanes
                would finish the season with a 10-game winning streak with a record of 13-1 on the season. This performance would go down as the greatest regular season performance
                in league history. But their job was far from over as they sought their first championship. In the semi-final round, The Huntingtown Hurricanes put up a disappointing
                performance, uncharacteristic of their historic regular season run. However, with only 80 points, it was enough to squeak out a ticket to the championship game.
                In the championship, The Huntingtown Hurricanes would have their biggest challenge yet as they had to face off against last year's champion The Dictator. In the end
                by a slim margin of just 5.58 points, The Huntingtown Hurricanes would claim their first championship victory, winning 15 out of their 16 games.
            <p>
                Coming off the greatest season by any team in league history, The Huntingtown Hurricanes sought to replicate this historic run. Though this year they were not
                as good as last year, they still had a very good season ending the year at 10-4 in second place. The Huntingtown Hurricanes would decisively win their semi-final
                matchup and would advance to their second straight championship game. Once again, they would face off against The Dictator. This time The Dictator would get their
                revenge and the Huntingtown Hurricanes would finish their season in second place.

            <p>
                By the beginning of the 2016 season, Zachary had moved away from his childhood home and childhood friends. Zachary and the rest of the league would soon grow distant
                and there was a heavy feeling that this would be the Huntingtown Hurricanes' last ride. Now looking to go to a third straight championship game, The Huntingtown Hurricanes
                would have a rather depressing season. They would finish their final year at a measly 4-10. They would win their first game in the consolation bracket and lose the
                second to end their time in this league in 6th place.

            <p>
                The feeling of a distance growing between the Huntingtown Hurricanes and the rest of the league proved to be very true as they would not be brought back for the 2017
                season. We will forever be thankful for the Huntingtown Hurricanes for being an orginal member of the RFL and carrying this league through some dark times. The Huntingtown Hurricanes
                will always be remembered for having the greatest season in league history, being one game shy of a perfect season.

            <br /> <strong>Biography</strong>
            <p>
                Ben Martin, an elementary school friend of the Commissioner, was allowed entry into the league in its inaugural season. In their first year, The Benskins would struggle
                to muster up wins
                as they finished the regular season at 2-11, finishing in 6th place. At the end of the season, they would enter into a play-in game for the playoffs against Venom.
                The Benskins would lose this matchup by a mere 1.02 points and would ultimately finish their first season in last place.
            <p>
                Going into the 2014 season, The Benskins sought revenge for their disappointing first season. This year The Benskins would greatly improve as they finished the year
                at 10-4 in third place. The Benskins had punched their ticket to their first ever playoff series. Unfortunately for them, they would be matched up with last year's
                champion, The Dictator, who would handedly defeat The Benskins. The Benskins would win the consolation game and finish their second campaign in third place.
            <p>
                Coming off their best season yet, The Benskins sought a return to the playoffs. However, it was apparent very early on that this desire would not come true.
                The Benskins ended the year at 5-9 in 6th place. They would once again finish in 6th place on the entirety of the season.

            <p>
                Going into what would be their final season in 2016, The Benskins looked to bounce back from last year's underwhelming performance. They managed to have a decent
                regular season finishing at 7-7, which was just good enough to clinch a playoff spot in fourth place. They would once again have to face off against the previous year's
                champion in the first round, The Dictator. This time, The Benskins did just enough to take down the former two-time champion to advance to their first championship game.
                In the championship game, they would narrowly be defeated by The Cookie Charizards by just 6.04 points. They would achieve their highest finish in franchise history
                in second place.

            <p>
                As a new era began to come in, some of the older franchises that had grown distant began to be removed. Owner Ben Martin and the Commissioner would soon grow apart
                and the Benskins would not return for the 2017 season.
                We will forever be thankful for the Benskins for being an original member of the RFL and carrying this league through some dark times. The Benskins
                will always be remembered for always being a competitor in a time where competitors were hard to find.

                including winning their first four games of the season. They ended the year in fourth place at an impressive 10-4, good enough to enter their playoff game. Unfortunately
                for The Winners, they would have to faceoff against the experienced The Dictator. The Winners would become the losers as they would be defeated by more than double their score in
                their first ever playoff game.
            <p>
                Going into the 2016 season, The Winners sought to avenge their embarrassing playoff performance and get back to the top. However, The Winners would put very little effort in to keeping up
                with their team. For the first four weeks of the season, The Winners had an empty quarterback and two running back slots. Furthermore, they did not even roster a defense or kicker
                for the entirety of the season. This lack of care allowed The Winners to finish the year in last place at 2-12. The Winners would be released from the RFL following the 2016 season
                for their constant failure to keep their lineup updated.

            <br /> <strong>Biography</strong>
            <p>
                In the league's inaugural season, it was tough to find enough competitors for the bare minimum allowed. Thus, the commissioner created his own temporary second franchise. This second team did
                fairly well on the year finishing the regular season in third place. They would defeat The Benskins in the quarterfinal and would go on and narrowly lose to Big Ounce in the semifinal.
                Following this season, the commissioner was able to recruit more people and thus this second franchise was officially retired.
